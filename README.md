## Collaborating tools collaborating together
Demo repository for showing how to connect Github with the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io)

Generally this repository is used as an example during a live workshop. If you have found your way here independently and are looking for instructions on how to connect your own Github repositories to your OSF project, see the [OSF Add-on Guide](http://help.osf.io/m/addons/l/524148-connect-add-ons) and the rest of the helpful information at [osf.io/support](https://osf.io/support).
